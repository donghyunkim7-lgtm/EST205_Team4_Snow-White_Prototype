In the fairy tale's absolute monarchy, where no law protected her from the Queen, kindness was her only survival strategy.

        analysis: "A moderate expression of Machiavellian Realism. Snow White's goodness partially survives, but it has been transformed from a moral essence into a political tool. She is kind when it's useful, harsh when necessary. Her 'adaptive behavior'—formed in the asymmetrical power relationship of her youth—has evolved into calculated governance rather than dissolving entirely.",

        analysis: "This ending embodies the Dogma/Cynicism framework's core claim: goodness is an illusion. Snow White's kindness was 'best understood not as a stable moral essence but as adaptive behavior in a violently unequal power relationship.'

        analysis: "The darkest expression of Dogma/Cynicism. Snow White's transformation proves that her childhood 'good heart' was never a fixed virtue—it was, as the abductive analysis suggests, an 'imagined future where, if she eventually obtained power, she could invert the structure that once oppressed her.' That inversion is now complete. The victim has become the victimizer, revealing that 'goodness' in asymmetrical power structures is merely a tactic of the weak.",

Every mirror in the kingdom is replaced with windows—symbols of looking outward, not inward. The Queen becomes a teacher, warning young people about the poison of comparison. And Snow White? She rules not because she has to be 'good' to survive, but because she chooses to be—freely, without fear, without calculation.",
        analysis: "The fullest expression of Emotionalism/Moral Idealism. Snow White's original 'adaptive behavior'—her childhood kindness born from powerlessness—has transformed into genuine moral agency. By forgiving the Queen (addressing the individual) AND destroying the mirrors (addressing the system), she breaks the cycle completely. This ending answers the core question: what happens to Snow White's goodness when power reverses? Here, it survives—not as a survival strategy, but as a free choice. Her goodness was not an illusion; it was a seed that, once freed from the soil of fear, could finally bloom.",
